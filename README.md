Human Capital Management API
============

Part of the Endava Mentorship program that ran between July and October 2022, the HumanCapitalManagement API project is part of a larger 
system of microservices, the Endava Space Program. This project represents a way for employees to have access to their colleagues information 
so that they can asses their expertise and be able to help each other.
The main objectives for creating this project were to create a full RESTful API with all the information needed:
 * A clearly defined architectural structure : API, Service, Persistance
 * A SQL Server Database
 * Unit Testing using xUnit
 * Logging using Serilog
 * Authentication and Authorization using JwtToken 
 * Error Handling Middleware
 * Validation using FluentValidation
